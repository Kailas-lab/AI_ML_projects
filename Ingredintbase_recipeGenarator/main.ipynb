    "### Step 1: Set Up Environment and Import Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a new project using LangChain and Google Gemini, we first need to import the necessary libraries. Here's what we'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`PromptTemplate`**: This helps in defining the structure and format of the prompts to send to the LLM (language model).\n",
    "- **`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`**: This is the class that interfaces with Google’s Gemini model. We'll use this to interact with the LLM and send requests.\n",
    "- **`LLMChain`**: This chains the model and prompt together. It enables sending the input prompt to the model and receiving a response.\n",
    "- **`os`**: This module allows us to work with environment variables, such as API keys, or to set up any configurations required for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why these are important:\n",
    "- **PromptTemplate** allows dynamic input to be used in prompts.\n",
    "- **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** is the interface to use Google's advanced language model (Gemini).\n",
    "- **LLMChain** simplifies the flow of sending prompts and getting responses.\n",
    "- **os** is essential for managing sensitive data like API keys securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s import the required modules to proceed with setting up the environment.\n"

    "\n",

    "  - The AI should include **estimated nutritional information** per serving (Calories, Carbohydrates, Protein, Fat, Fiber, Sodium).\n",

Cover the skillet and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly.  If the sauce becomes too thick, add a little more water.\n",
