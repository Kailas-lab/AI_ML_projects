      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n",
      "* 1 cup curd (plain yogurt)\n",
      "* 1 tbsp ground black pepper\n",
      "* 1 tbsp instant coffee powder\n",
      "* Salt (to taste)\n",
      "* Water (as needed)\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Coffee-Pepper Crust:** In a small bowl, combine the ground black pepper and instant coffee powder.  Mix well.\n",
      "2. **Coat the Chicken:** Season the chicken breasts generously with salt.  Press the coffee-pepper mixture firmly onto both sides of each chicken breast, ensuring even coverage.\n",
      "3. **Sear the Chicken:** Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breasts for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and slightly crispy.\n",
      "4. **Simmer in Curd:** Reduce the heat to medium-low. Pour ½ cup of water into the skillet. Add the curd and stir to combine.  Cover the skillet and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly.  If the sauce becomes too thick, add a little more water.\n",
      "5. **Serve:** Serve the chicken immediately, spooning the creamy curd sauce over the top.\n",
